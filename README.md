This repository was created in 2024 and contains pages to familiarize myself with data structures in Java. The goal was to understand common data structures and their methods. 

**Note:** Not intended to be runnable, contains missing and unfinished code segments

**Each folder includes:**
- The Java implementation of a data structure (although some are unfinished or incorrect)
- A corresponding JUnit test file to validate functionality
- Comments for explanation

**Data Structures:** Stack, Queue, Queue made through 2 stacks, Node, LinkedList, Hashmap

**Language:** Java 17  
**Testing:** JUnit 5  
**IDE:** Eclipse
